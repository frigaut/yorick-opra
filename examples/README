This is the README file for the example directory of OPRA,
a Phase Diversity package written in yorick.

To run an example, do:

yorick -i opra_test#.i
where # goes from 1 through 6:

opra_test1.i   Single direction, 3 images, uses GTK GUI
opra_test2.i   Single direction, 3 images, does not uses GTK GUI

Note that for the next examples to run, you'll need to generate
the related data files (synthetic data) using
yorick -i gen_test#_images.i  (# = 3 through 5)

opra_test3.i  Tomography w/ 5 dir. x 3 images, GTK GUI, svipc
opra_test4.i  Tomography w/ 5 dir. x 3 images, no GTK GUI, no svipc
opra_test5.i  Tomography w/ 5 dir. x 3 images, no GTK GUI, no svipc
opra_test6.i  Uses a serie of Gemini images (NIRI), no GUI, no svipc

As said above, *some* tests require gtk (the one with the GTK GUI), so
if you don't have gtk installed they will fail (e.g. in some install of yorick in OsX).

The testclean script cleans all files generated by running the examples.
